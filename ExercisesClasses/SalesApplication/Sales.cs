         * In this exercise we want to create a class that hold a sale transaction that an employee
         * makes with a client. The sales class should contain a name of the product sold, the money sold for
         * in dollars (double), and a client class that references a client. Also, create a DateTime property that
         * hold the information about when the sale was made. Let the employee class hold a collection of
         * sales objects and implement a method that adds a new sales to the list. Also, create a constructor
         * that instantiates the sales object. The date of the sale can be created in the constructor as the
         * current date (DateTime.Now).
